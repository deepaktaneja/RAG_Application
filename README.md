SYNOPSIS OF A CHRISTMAS CAROL
A Christmas Carol is a short novel by the British writer Charles
Dickens. 
MARLEY’S GHOST.
Marley was dead: to begin with. There is no doubt whatever
about that. The register of his burial was signed by the
clergyman, the clerk, the undertaker, and the chief mourner.
Scrooge signed it: and Scrooge’s name was good upon
’Change, for anything he chose to put his hand to. Old Marley
was as dead as a door-nail.
Mind! I don’t mean to say that I know, of my own knowledge,
what there is particularly dead about a door-nail. I might have
been inclined, myself, to regard a coffin-nail as the deadest
piece of ironmongery in the trade. But the wisdom of our
ancestors is in the simile; and my unhallowed hands shall not
disturb it, or the Country’s done for. You will therefore permit
me to repeat, emphatically, that Marley was as dead as a doornail.
Scrooge knew he was dead? Of course he did. How could it be
otherwise? Scrooge and he were partners for I don’t know how
many years. Scrooge was his sole executor, his sole
administrator, his sole assign, his sole residuary legatee, his sole
friend, and sole mourner. And even Scrooge was not so
dreadfully cut up by the sad event, but that he was an excellent
4
man of business on the very day of the funeral, and solemnised
it with an undoubted bargain.
The mention of Marley’s funeral brings me back to the point I
started from. There is no doubt that Marley was dead. This must
be distinctly understood, or nothing wonderful can come of the
story I am going to relate. If we were not perfectly convinced
that Hamlet’s Father died before the play began, there would be
nothing more remarkable in his taking a stroll at night, in an
easterly wind, upon his own ramparts, than there would be in
any other middle-aged gentleman rashly turning out after dark
in a breezy spot—say Saint Paul’s Churchyard for instance—
literally to astonish his son’s weak mind.
Scrooge never painted out Old Marley’s name. There it stood,
years afterwards, above the warehouse door: Scrooge and
Marley. The firm was known as Scrooge and Marley. Sometimes
people new to the business called Scrooge Scrooge, and
sometimes Marley, but he answered to both names. It was all
the same to him.
Oh! But he was a tight-fisted hand at the grindstone, Scrooge! a
squeezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous,
old sinner! Hard and sharp as flint, from which no steel had ever
struck out generous fire; secret, and self- contained, and
solitary as an oyster. The cold within him froze his old features,
5
nipped his pointed nose, shrivelled his cheek, stiffened his gait;
made his eyes red, his thin lips blue; and spoke out shrewdly in
his grating voice. A frosty rime was on his head, and on his
eyebrows, and his wiry chin. He carried his own low temperature
always about with him; he iced his office in the dog- days; and
didn’t thaw it one degree at Christmas.
External heat and cold had little influence on Scrooge. No
warmth could warm, no wintry weather chill him. No wind that
blew was bitterer than he, no falling snow was more intent upon
its purpose, no pelting rain less open to entreaty. Foul weather
didn’t know where to have him. The heaviest rain, and snow,
and hail, and sleet, could boast of the advantage over him in
only one respect. They often “came down” handsomely, and
Scrooge never did.
Nobody ever stopped him in the street to say, with gladsome
looks, “My dear Scrooge, how are you? When will you come to
see me?” No beggars implored him to bestow a trifle, no
children asked him what it was o’clock, no man or woman ever
once in all his life inquired the way to such and such a place, of
Scrooge. Even the blind men’s dogs appeared to know him; and
when they saw him coming on, would tug their owners into
doorways and up courts; and then would wag their tails as
though they said, “No eye at all is better than an evil eye, dark
master!”
But what did Scrooge care! It was the very thing he liked. To
edge his way along the crowded paths of life, warning all
6
human sympathy to keep its distance, was what the knowing
ones call “nuts” to Scrooge.
Once upon a time—of all the good days in the year, on
Christmas Eve— old Scrooge sat busy in his counting-house. It
was cold, bleak, biting weather: foggy withal: and he could hear
the people in the court outside, go wheezing up and down,
beating their hands upon their breasts, and stamping their feet
upon the pavement stones to warm them. The city clocks had
only just gone three, but it was quite dark already—it had not
been light all day—and candles were flaring in the windows of
the neighbouring offices, like ruddy smears upon the palpable
brown air. The fog came pouring in at every chink and keyhole,
and was so dense without, that although the court was of the
narrowest, the houses opposite were mere phantoms. To see the
dingy cloud come drooping down, obscuring everything, one
might have thought that Nature lived hard by, and was brewing
on a large scale.
The door of Scrooge’s counting-house was open that he might
keep his eye upon his clerk, who in a dismal little cell beyond, a
sort of tank, was copying letters. Scrooge had a very small fire,
but the clerk’s fire was so very much smaller that it looked like
one coal. But he couldn’t replenish it, for Scrooge kept the coalbox
in his own room; and so surely as the clerk came in with the
shovel, the master predicted that it would be necessary for
them to part.
7
Wherefore the clerk put on his white comforter, and tried to
warm himself at the candle; in which effort, not being a man of
a strong imagination, he failed.
“A merry Christmas, uncle! God save you!” cried a cheerful
voice. It was the voice of Scrooge’s nephew, who came upon
him so quickly that this was the first intimation he had of his
approach.
“Bah!” said Scrooge, “Humbug!”
He had so heated himself with rapid walking in the fog and
frost, this nephew of Scrooge’s, that he was all in a glow; his
face was ruddy and handsome; his eyes sparkled, and his
breath smoked again.
“Christmas a humbug, uncle!” said Scrooge’s nephew. “You
don’t mean that, I am sure?”
“I do,” said Scrooge. “Merry Christmas! What right have you to
be merry?
What reason have you to be merry? You’re poor enough.”
“Come, then,” returned the nephew gaily. “What right have you
to be dismal? What reason have you to be morose? You’re rich
enough.”
Scrooge having no better answer ready on the spur of the
moment, said, “Bah!” again; and followed it up with “Humbug.”
“Don’t be cross, uncle!” said the nephew.
8
“What else can I be,” returned the uncle, “when I live in such a
world of fools as this? Merry Christmas! Out upon merry
Christmas! What’s Christmas time to you but a time for paying
bills without money; a time for finding yourself a year older, but
not an hour richer; a time for balancing your books and having
every item in ’em through a round dozen of months presented
dead against you? If I could work my will,” said Scrooge
indignantly, “every idiot who goes about with ‘Merry Christmas’
on his lips, should be boiled with his own pudding, and buried
with a stake of holly through his heart. He should!”
“Uncle!” pleaded the nephew.
“Nephew!” returned the uncle sternly, “keep Christmas in your
own way, and let me keep it in mine.”
“Keep it!” repeated Scrooge’s nephew. “But you don’t keep it.”
“Let me leave it alone, then,” said Scrooge. “Much good may it
do you!
Much good it has ever done you!”
“There are many things from which I might have derived good,
by which I have not profited, I dare say,” returned the nephew.
“Christmas among the rest. But I am sure I have always
thought of Christmas time, when it has come round—apart from
the veneration due to its sacred name and origin, if
9
anything belonging to it can be apart from that—as a good
time; a kind, forgiving, charitable, pleasant time; the only time I
know of, in the long calendar of the year, when men and women
seem by one consent to open their shut-up hearts freely, and to
think of people below them as if they really were fellowpassengers
to the grave, and not another race of creatures
bound on other journeys. And therefore, uncle, though it has
never put a scrap of gold or silver in my pocket, I believe that it
has done me good, and will do me good; and I say, God bless
it!”
The clerk in the Tank involuntarily applauded. Becoming
immediately sensible of the impropriety, he poked the fire, and
extinguished the last frail spark for ever.
“Let me hear another sound from you,” said Scrooge, “and you’ll
keep your Christmas by losing your situation! You’re quite a
powerful speaker, sir,” he added, turning to his nephew. “I
wonder you don’t go into Parliament.”
“Don’t be angry, uncle. Come! Dine with us to-morrow.”
Scrooge said that he would see him—yes, indeed he did. He
went the whole length of the expression, and said that he would
see him in that extremity first.
“But why?” cried Scrooge’s nephew. “Why?” “Why did you get
married?” said Scrooge. “Because I fell in love.”
10
“Because you fell in love!” growled Scrooge, as if that were the
only one thing in the world more ridiculous than a merry
Christmas. “Good afternoon!”
“Nay, uncle, but you never came to see me before that
happened. Why give it as a reason for not coming now?”
“Good afternoon,” said Scrooge.
“I want nothing from you; I ask nothing of you; why cannot we
be friends?”
“Good afternoon,” said Scrooge.
“I am sorry, with all my heart, to find you so resolute. We have
never had any quarrel, to which I have been a party. But I have
made the trial in homage to Christmas, and I’ll keep my
Christmas humour to the last. So A Merry Christmas, uncle!”
“Good afternoon!” said Scrooge. “And A Happy New Year!”
“Good afternoon!” said Scrooge.
His nephew left the room without an angry word,
notwithstanding. He stopped at the outer door to bestow the
greetings of the season on the clerk, who, cold as he was, was
warmer than Scrooge; for he returned them cordially.
“There’s another fellow,” muttered Scrooge; who overheard him:
“my clerk, with fifteen shillings a week, and a wife and family,
talking about a merry Christmas. I’ll retire to Bedlam.”
11
This lunatic, in letting Scrooge’s nephew out, had let two other
people in. They were portly gentlemen, pleasant to behold, and
now stood, with their hats off, in Scrooge’s office. They had
books and papers in their hands, and bowed to him.
“Scrooge and Marley’s, I believe,” said one of the gentlemen,
referring to his list. “Have I the pleasure of addressing Mr.
Scrooge, or Mr. Marley?”
“Mr. Marley has been dead these seven years,” Scrooge replied.
“He died seven years ago, this very night.”
“We have no doubt his liberality is well represented by his
surviving partner,” said the gentleman, presenting his
credentials.
It certainly was; for they had been two kindred spirits. At the
ominous word “liberality,” Scrooge frowned, and shook his
head, and handed the credentials back.
“At this festive season of the year, Mr. Scrooge,” said the
gentleman, taking up a pen, “it is more than usually desirable
that we should make some slight provision for the Poor and
destitute, who suffer greatly at the present time. Many
thousands are in want of common necessaries; hundreds of
thousands are in want of common comforts, sir.”
“Are there no prisons?” asked Scrooge.
“Plenty of prisons,” said the gentleman, laying down the pen
again.
12
“And the Union workhouses?” demanded Scrooge. “Are they still
in operation?”
“They are. Still,” returned the gentleman, “I wish I could say they
were not.”
“The Treadmill and the Poor Law are in full vigour, then?” said
Scrooge. “Both very busy, sir.”
“Oh! I was afraid, from what you said at first, that something
had occurred to stop them in their useful course,” said Scrooge.
“I’m very glad to hear it.”
“Under the impression that they scarcely furnish Christian cheer
of mind or body to the multitude,” returned the gentleman, “a
few of us are endeavouring to raise a fund to buy the Poor
some meat and drink, and means of warmth. We choose this
time, because it is a time, of all others, when Want is keenly felt,
and Abundance rejoices. What shall I put you down for?”
“Nothing!” Scrooge replied. “You wish to be anonymous?”
“I wish to be left alone,” said Scrooge. “Since you ask me what I
wish, gentlemen, that is my answer. I don’t make merry myself
at Christmas and I can’t afford to make idle people merry. I
help to support the establishments I have mentioned—they cost
enough; and those who are badly off must go there.”
“Many can’t go there; and many would rather die.”
13
“If they would rather die,” said Scrooge, “they had better do it,
and decrease the surplus population. Besides—excuse me—I
don’t know that.”
“But you might know it,” observed the gentleman.
“It’s not my business,” Scrooge returned. “It’s enough for a man
to understand his own business, and not to interfere with other
people’s. Mine occupies me constantly. Good afternoon,
gentlemen!”
Seeing clearly that it would be useless to pursue their point, the
gentlemen withdrew. Scrooge resumed his labours with an
improved opinion of himself, and in a more facetious temper
than was usual with him.
Meanwhile the fog and darkness thickened so, that people ran
about with flaring links, proffering their services to go before
horses in carriages, and conduct them on their way. The ancient
tower of a church, whose gruff old bell was always peeping slily
down at Scrooge out of a Gothic window in the wall, became
invisible, and struck the hours and quarters in the clouds, with
tremulous vibrations afterwards as if its teeth were chattering in
its frozen head up there. The cold became intense. In the main
street, at the corner of the court, some labourers were repairing
the gas-pipes, and had lighted a great fire in a brazier, round
which a party of ragged men and boys were gathered: warming
their hands and winking their eyes before the blaze in rapture.
The water-plug being left in solitude, its overflowings sullenly
14
congealed, and turned to misanthropic ice. The brightness of
the shops where holly sprigs and berries crackled in the lamp
heat of the windows, made pale faces ruddy as they passed.
Poulterers’ and grocers’ trades became a splendid joke: a
glorious pageant, with which it was next to impossible to believe
that such dull principles as bargain and sale had anything to do.
The Lord Mayor, in the
stronghold of the mighty Mansion House, gave orders to his
fifty cooks and butlers to keep Christmas as a Lord Mayor’s
household should; and even the little tailor, whom he had fined
five shillings on the previous Monday for being drunk and
bloodthirsty in the streets, stirred up to-morrow’s pudding in his
garret, while his lean wife and the baby sallied out to buy the
beef.
Foggier yet, and colder. Piercing, searching, biting cold. If the
good Saint Dunstan had but nipped the Evil Spirit’s nose with a
touch of such weather as that, instead of using his familiar
weapons, then indeed he would have roared to lusty purpose.
The owner of one scant young nose, gnawed and mumbled by
the hungry cold as bones are gnawed by dogs, stooped down at
Scrooge’s keyhole to regale him with a Christmas carol: but at
the first sound of
“God bless you, merry gentleman! May nothing you dismay!”
15
Scrooge seized the ruler with such energy of action, that the
singer fled in terror, leaving the keyhole to the fog and even
more congenial frost.
At length the hour of shutting up the counting-house arrived.
With an ill- will Scrooge dismounted from his stool, and tacitly
admitted the fact to the expectant clerk in the Tank, who
instantly snuffed his candle out, and put on his hat.
“You’ll want all day to-morrow, I suppose?” said Scrooge. “If
quite convenient, sir.”
“It’s not convenient,” said Scrooge, “and it’s not fair. If I was to
stop half- a-crown for it, you’d think yourself ill-used, I’ll be
bound?”
The clerk smiled faintly.
“And yet,” said Scrooge, “you don’t think me ill-used, when I pay
a day’s wages for no work.”
The clerk observed that it was only once a year.
“A poor excuse for picking a man’s pocket every twenty-fifth of
December!” said Scrooge, buttoning his great-coat to the chin.
“But I suppose you must have the whole day. Be here all the
earlier next morning.”
The clerk promised that he would; and Scrooge walked out with
a growl. The office was closed in a twinkling, and the clerk, with
the long ends of his white comforter dangling below his waist
(for he boasted no great-coat), went down a slide on Cornhill, at
16
the end of a lane of boys, twenty times, in honour of its being
Christmas Eve, and then ran home to Camden Town as hard as
he could pelt, to play at blindman’s-buff.
Scrooge took his melancholy dinner in his usual melancholy
tavern; and having read all the newspapers, and beguiled the
rest of the evening with his banker’s-book, went home to bed.
He lived in chambers which had once belonged to his deceased
partner. They were a gloomy suite of rooms, in a lowering pile of
building up a yard, where it had so little business to be, that one
could scarcely help fancying it must have run there when it was
a young house, playing at hide-and-seek with other houses, and
forgotten the way out again. It was old enough now, and dreary
enough, for nobody lived in it but Scrooge, the other rooms
being all let out as offices. The yard was so dark that even
Scrooge, who knew its every stone, was fain to grope with his
hands. The fog and frost so hung about the black old gateway
of the house, that it seemed as if the Genius of the Weather sat
in mournful meditation on the threshold.
Now, it is a fact, that there was nothing at all particular about
the knocker on the door, except that it was very large. It is also
a fact, that Scrooge had seen it, night and morning, during his
whole residence in that place; also that Scrooge had as little of
what is called fancy about him as any man in the city of
London, even including—which is a bold word—the corporation,
aldermen, and livery. Let it also be borne in mind that Scrooge
17
had not bestowed one thought on Marley, since his last mention
of his seven years’ dead partner that afternoon. And then let
any man explain to me, if he can, how it happened that
Scrooge, having his key in the lock of the door, saw in the
knocker, without its undergoing any intermediate process of
change—not a knocker, but Marley’s face.
Marley’s face. It was not in impenetrable shadow as the other
objects in the yard were, but had a dismal light about it, like a
bad lobster in a dark cellar. It was not angry or ferocious, but
looked at Scrooge as Marley used to look: with ghostly
spectacles turned up on its ghostly forehead. The hair was
curiously stirred, as if by breath or hot air; and, though the eyes
were wide open, they were perfectly motionless. That, and its
livid colour, made it horrible; but its horror seemed to be in spite
of the face and beyond its control, rather than a part of its own
expression.
As Scrooge looked fixedly at this phenomenon, it was a knocker
again.
To say that he was not startled, or that his blood was not
conscious of a terrible sensation to which it had been a stranger
from infancy, would be untrue. But he put his hand upon the key
he had relinquished, turned it sturdily, walked in, and lighted his
candle.
He did pause, with a moment’s irresolution, before he shut the
door; and he did look cautiously behind it first, as if he half
18
expected to be terrified with the sight of Marley’s pigtail
sticking out into the hall. But there was nothing on the back of
the door, except the screws and nuts that held the knocker on,
so
he said “Pooh, pooh!” and closed it with a bang.
The sound resounded through the house like thunder. Every
room above, and every cask in the wine-merchant’s cellars
below, appeared to have a separate peal of echoes of its own.
Scrooge was not a man to be frightened by echoes. He
fastened the door, and walked across the hall, and up the stairs;
slowly too: trimming his candle as he went.
You may talk vaguely about driving a coach-and-six up a good
old flight of stairs, or through a bad young Act of Parliament;
but I mean to say you might have got a hearse up that
staircase, and taken it broadwise, with the splinter- bar towards
the wall and the door towards the balustrades: and done it easy.
There was plenty of width for that, and room to spare; which is
perhaps the reason why Scrooge thought he saw a locomotive
hearse going on before him in the gloom. Half-a-dozen gaslamps
out of the street wouldn’t have lighted the entry too well,
so you may suppose that it was pretty dark with Scrooge’s dip.
Up Scrooge went, not caring a button for that. Darkness is
cheap, and Scrooge liked it. But before he shut his heavy door,
19
he walked through his rooms to see that all was right. He had
just enough recollection of the face to desire to do that.
Sitting-room, bedroom, lumber-room. All as they should be.
Nobody under the table, nobody under the sofa; a small fire in
the grate; spoon and basin ready; and the little saucepan of
gruel (Scrooge had a cold in his head) upon the hob. Nobody
under the bed; nobody in the closet; nobody in his dressinggown,
which was hanging up in a suspicious attitude against
the wall. Lumber- room as usual. Old fire-guard, old shoes, two
fish-baskets, washing-stand on three legs, and a poker.
Quite satisfied, he closed his door, and locked himself in;
double-locked himself in, which was not his custom. Thus
secured against surprise, he took off his cravat; put on his
dressing-gown and slippers, and his nightcap; and sat down
before the fire to take his gruel.
It was a very low fire indeed; nothing on such a bitter night. He
was obliged to sit close to it, and brood over it, before he could
extract the least sensation of warmth from such a handful of
fuel. The fireplace was an old one, built by some Dutch
merchant long ago, and paved all round with quaint Dutch tiles,
designed to illustrate the Scriptures. There were Cains and
Abels, Pharaoh’s daughters; Queens of Sheba, Angelic
messengers descending through the air on clouds like featherbeds,
Abrahams, Belshazzars, Apostles putting off to sea in
butter-boats, hundreds of figures to attract his thoughts; and
yet that face of Marley, seven years dead, came like the ancient
20
Prophet’s rod, and swallowed up the whole. If each smooth tile
had been a blank at first,
with power to shape some picture on its surface from the
disjointed fragments of his thoughts, there would have been a
copy of old Marley’s head on every one.
“Humbug!” said Scrooge; and walked across the room.
After several turns, he sat down again. As he threw his head
back in the chair, his glance happened to rest upon a bell, a
disused bell, that hung in the room, and communicated for
some purpose now forgotten with a chamber in the highest
story of the building. It was with great astonishment, and with a
strange, inexplicable dread, that as he looked, he saw this bell
begin to swing. It swung so softly in the outset that it scarcely
made a sound; but soon it rang out loudly, and so did every bell
in the house.
This might have lasted half a minute, or a minute, but it seemed
an hour. The bells ceased as they had begun, together. They
were succeeded by a clanking noise, deep down below; as if
some person were dragging a heavy chain over the casks in the
wine-merchant’s cellar. Scrooge then remembered to have
heard that ghosts in haunted houses were described as
dragging chains.
21
The cellar-door flew open with a booming sound, and then he
heard the noise much louder, on the floors below; then coming
up the stairs; then coming straight towards his door.
“It’s humbug still!” said Scrooge. “I won’t believe it.”
His colour changed though, when, without a pause, it came on
through the heavy door, and passed into the room before his
eyes. Upon its coming in, the dying flame leaped up, as though
it cried, “I know him; Marley’s Ghost!” and fell again.
The same face: the very same. Marley in his pigtail, usual
waistcoat, tights and boots; the tassels on the latter bristling,
like his pigtail, and his coat-skirts, and the hair upon his head.
The chain he drew was clasped about his middle. It was long,
and wound about him like a tail; and it was made (for Scrooge
observed it closely) of cash-boxes, keys, padlocks, ledgers,
deeds, and heavy purses wrought in steel. His body was
transparent; so that Scrooge, observing him, and looking
through his waistcoat, could see the two buttons on his coat
behind.
Scrooge had often heard it said that Marley had no bowels, but
he had never believed it until now.
No, nor did he believe it even now. Though he looked the
phantom through and through, and saw it standing before him;
though he felt the chilling influence of its death-cold eyes; and
marked the very texture of the folded kerchief bound about its
head and chin, which wrapper he had not observed
22
before; he was still incredulous, and fought against his senses.
“How now!” said Scrooge, caustic and cold as ever. “What do
you want with me?”
“Much!”—Marley’s voice, no doubt about it. “Who are you?”
“Ask me who I was.”
“Who were you then?” said Scrooge, raising his voice. “You’re
particular, for a shade.” He was going to say “to a shade,” but
substituted this, as more appropriate.
“In life I was your partner, Jacob Marley.”
“Can you—can you sit down?” asked Scrooge, looking
doubtfully at him. “I can.”
“Do it, then.”
Scrooge asked the question, because he didn’t know whether a
ghost so transparent might find himself in a condition to take a
chair; and felt that in the event of its being impossible, it might
involve the necessity of an embarrassing explanation. But the
ghost sat down on the opposite side of the fireplace, as if he
were quite used to it.
“You don’t believe in me,” observed the Ghost. “I don’t,” said
Scrooge.
“What evidence would you have of my reality beyond that of
your senses?”
23
“I don’t know,” said Scrooge. “Why do you doubt your senses?”
“Because,” said Scrooge, “a little thing affects them. A slight
disorder of the stomach makes them cheats. You may be an
undigested bit of beef, a blot of mustard, a crumb of cheese, a
fragment of an underdone potato. There’s more of gravy than
of grave about you, whatever you are!”
Scrooge was not much in the habit of cracking jokes, nor did he
feel, in his heart, by any means waggish then. The truth is, that
he tried to be smart, as a means of distracting his own
attention, and keeping down his terror; for the spectre’s voice
disturbed the very marrow in his bones.
To sit, staring at those fixed glazed eyes, in silence for a
moment, would play, Scrooge felt, the very deuce with him.
There was something very awful,
too, in the spectre’s being provided with an infernal atmosphere
of its own. Scrooge could not feel it himself, but this was clearly
the case; for though the Ghost sat perfectly motionless, its hair,
and skirts, and tassels, were still agitated as by the hot vapour
from an oven.
“You see this toothpick?” said Scrooge, returning quickly to the
charge, for the reason just assigned; and wishing, though it
were only for a second, to divert the vision’s stony gaze from
himself.
24
“I do,” replied the Ghost.
“You are not looking at it,” said Scrooge.
“But I see it,” said the Ghost, “notwithstanding.”
“Well!” returned Scrooge, “I have but to swallow this, and be for
the rest of my days persecuted by a legion of goblins, all of my
own creation. Humbug, I tell you! humbug!”
At this the spirit raised a frightful cry, and shook its chain with
such a dismal and appalling noise, that Scrooge held on tight to
his chair, to save himself from falling in a swoon. But how much
greater was his horror, when the phantom taking off the
bandage round its head, as if it were too warm to wear indoors,
its lower jaw dropped down upon its breast!
Scrooge fell upon his knees, and clasped his hands before his
face. “Mercy!” he said. “Dreadful apparition, why do you trouble
me?”
“Man of the worldly mind!” replied the Ghost, “do you believe in
me or not?”
“I do,” said Scrooge. “I must. But why do spirits walk the earth,
and why do they come to me?”
“It is required of every man,” the Ghost returned, “that the spirit
within him should walk abroad among his fellowmen, and travel
far and wide; and if that spirit goes not forth in life, it is
condemned to do so after death. It is doomed to wander
through the world—oh, woe is me!—and witness what it cannot
25
share, but might have shared on earth, and turned to
happiness!”
Again the spectre raised a cry, and shook its chain and wrung
its shadowy hands.
“You are fettered,” said Scrooge, trembling. “Tell me why?”
“I wear the chain I forged in life,” replied the Ghost. “I made it
link by link, and yard by yard; I girded it on of my own free will,
and of my own free will I wore it. Is its pattern strange to you?”
Scrooge trembled more and more.
“Or would you know,” pursued the Ghost, “the weight and length
of the strong coil you bear yourself? It was full as heavy and as
long as this, seven Christmas Eves ago. You have laboured on it,
since. It is a ponderous chain!”
Scrooge glanced about him on the floor, in the expectation of
finding himself surrounded by some fifty or sixty fathoms of
iron cable: but he could see nothing.
“Jacob,” he said, imploringly. “Old Jacob Marley, tell me more.
Speak comfort to me, Jacob!”
“I have none to give,” the Ghost replied. “It comes from other
regions, Ebenezer Scrooge, and is conveyed by other ministers,
to other kinds of men. Nor can I tell you what I would. A very
little more is all permitted to me. I cannot rest, I cannot stay, I
cannot linger anywhere. My spirit never walked beyond our
26
counting-house—mark me!—in life my spirit never roved beyond
the narrow limits of our money-changing hole; and weary
journeys lie before me!”
It was a habit with Scrooge, whenever he became thoughtful, to
put his hands in his breeches pockets. Pondering on what the
Ghost had said, he did so now, but without lifting up his eyes, or
getting off his knees.
“You must have been very slow about it, Jacob,” Scrooge
observed, in a business-like manner, though with humility and
deference.
“Slow!” the Ghost repeated.
“Seven years dead,” mused Scrooge. “And travelling all the
time!”
“The whole time,” said the Ghost. “No rest, no peace. Incessant
torture of remorse.”
“You travel fast?” said Scrooge.
“On the wings of the wind,” replied the Ghost.
“You might have got over a great quantity of ground in seven
years,” said Scrooge.
The Ghost, on hearing this, set up another cry, and clanked its
chain so hideously in the dead silence of the night, that the
Ward would have been justified in indicting it for a nuisance.

“Oh! captive, bound, and double-ironed,” cried the phantom,
“not to know, that ages of incessant labour by immortal
creatures, for this earth must pass into eternity before the good
of which it is susceptible is all developed. Not to know that any
Christian spirit working kindly in its little sphere, whatever it may
be, will find its mortal life too short for its vast means of
usefulness. Not to know that no space of regret can make
amends for one life’s opportunity
misused! Yet such was I! Oh! such was I!”
“But you were always a good man of business, Jacob,” faltered
Scrooge, who now began to apply this to himself.
“Business!” cried the Ghost, wringing its hands again. “Mankind
was my business. The common welfare was my business;
charity, mercy, forbearance, and benevolence, were, all, my
business. The dealings of my trade were but a drop of water in
the comprehensive ocean of my business!”
It held up its chain at arm’s length, as if that were the cause of
all its unavailing grief, and flung it heavily upon the ground
again.
“At this time of the rolling year,” the spectre said, “I suffer most.
Why did I walk through crowds of fellow-beings with my eyes
turned down, and never raise them to that blessed Star which
led the Wise Men to a poor abode! Were there no poor homes to
which its light would have conducted me!”

dong, bell. Bell, dong, ding; hammer, clang, clash! Oh, glorious,
glorious!
Running to the window, he opened it, and put out his head. No
fog, no mist; clear, bright, jovial, stirring, cold; cold, piping for
the blood to dance to; Golden sunlight; Heavenly sky; sweet
fresh air; merry bells. Oh, glorious! Glorious!
“What’s to-day!” cried Scrooge, calling downward to a boy in
Sunday clothes, who perhaps had loitered in to look about him.
“Eh?” returned the boy, with all his might of wonder. “What’s today,
my fine fellow?” said Scrooge.
“To-day!” replied the boy. “Why, Christmas Day.”
“It’s Christmas Day!” said Scrooge to himself. “I haven’t missed
it. The Spirits have done it all in one night. They can do anything
they like. Of course they can. Of course they can. Hallo, my fine
fellow!”
“Hallo!” returned the boy.
“Do you know the Poulterer’s, in the next street but one, at the
corner?” Scrooge inquired.
“I should hope I did,” replied the lad.
“An intelligent boy!” said Scrooge. “A remarkable boy! Do you
know whether they’ve sold the prize Turkey that was hanging up
there?—Not the little prize Turkey: the big one?”
120
“What, the one as big as me?” returned the boy.
“What a delightful boy!” said Scrooge. “It’s a pleasure to talk to
him. Yes, my buck!”
“It’s hanging there now,” replied the boy. “Is it?” said Scrooge.
“Go and buy it.” “Walk-er!” exclaimed the boy.
“No, no,” said Scrooge, “I am in earnest. Go and buy it, and tell
’em to bring it here, that I may give them the direction where to
take it. Come back with the man, and I’ll give you a shilling.
Come back with him in less than five minutes and I’ll give you
half-a-crown!”
The boy was off like a shot. He must have had a steady hand at
a trigger who could have got a shot off half so fast.
“I’ll send it to Bob Cratchit’s!” whispered Scrooge, rubbing his
hands, and splitting with a laugh. “He sha’n’t know who sends it.
It’s twice the size of Tiny Tim. Joe Miller never made such a joke
as sending it to Bob’s will be!”
The hand in which he wrote the address was not a steady one,
but write it he did, somehow, and went down-stairs to open the
street door, ready for the coming of the poulterer’s man. As he
stood there, waiting his arrival, the knocker caught his eye.
“I shall love it, as long as I live!” cried Scrooge, patting it with
his hand. “I scarcely ever looked at it before. What an honest
121
expression it has in its face! It’s a wonderful knocker!—Here’s
the Turkey! Hallo! Whoop! How are you! Merry Christmas!”
It was a Turkey! He never could have stood upon his legs, that
bird. He would have snapped ’em short off in a minute, like
sticks of sealing-wax.
“Why, it’s impossible to carry that to Camden Town,” said
Scrooge. “You must have a cab.”
The chuckle with which he said this, and the chuckle with which
he paid for the Turkey, and the chuckle with which he paid for
the cab, and the chuckle with which he recompensed the boy,
were only to be exceeded by the chuckle with which he sat
down breathless in his chair again, and chuckled till he cried.
Shaving was not an easy task, for his hand continued to shake
very much; and shaving requires attention, even when you don’t
dance while you are at it. But if he had cut the end of his nose
off, he would have put a piece of sticking- plaister over it, and
been quite satisfied.
He dressed himself “all in his best,” and at last got out into the
streets. The people were by this time pouring forth, as he had
seen them with the Ghost of Christmas Present; and walking
with his hands behind him, Scrooge regarded every one with a
delighted smile. He looked so irresistibly pleasant, in a word,
that three or four good-humoured fellows said, “Good morning,
sir! A merry Christmas to you!” And Scrooge said often
122
afterwards, that of all the blithe sounds he had ever heard,
those were the blithest in his ears.
He had not gone far, when coming on towards him he beheld
the portly
gentleman, who had walked into his counting-house the day
before, and said, “Scrooge and Marley’s, I believe?” It sent a
pang across his heart to think how this old gentleman would
look upon him when they met; but he knew what path lay
straight before him, and he took it.
“My dear sir,” said Scrooge, quickening his pace, and taking the
old gentleman by both his hands. “How do you do? I hope you
succeeded yesterday. It was very kind of you. A merry
Christmas to you, sir!”
“Mr. Scrooge?”
“Yes,” said Scrooge. “That is my name, and I fear it may not be
pleasant to you. Allow me to ask your pardon. And will you have
the goodness”—here Scrooge whispered in his ear.
“Lord bless me!” cried the gentleman, as if his breath were
taken away. “My dear Mr. Scrooge, are you serious?”
“If you please,” said Scrooge. “Not a farthing less. A great
many back- payments are included in it, I assure you. Will you
do me that favour?”
123
“My dear sir,” said the other, shaking hands with him. “I don’t
know what to say to such munifi—”
“Don’t say anything, please,” retorted Scrooge. “Come and see
me. Will you come and see me?”
“I will!” cried the old gentleman. And it was clear he meant to do
it. “Thank’ee,” said Scrooge. “I am much obliged to you. I thank
you fifty
times. Bless you!”
He went to church, and walked about the streets, and watched
the people hurrying to and fro, and patted children on the head,
and questioned beggars, and looked down into the kitchens of
houses, and up to the windows, and found that everything could
yield him pleasure. He had never dreamed that any walk—that
anything—could give him so much happiness. In the afternoon
he turned his steps towards his nephew’s house.
He passed the door a dozen times, before he had the courage
to go up and knock. But he made a dash, and did it:
“Is your master at home, my dear?” said Scrooge to the girl.
Nice girl!
Very.
“Yes, sir.”
“Where is he, my love?” said Scrooge.
124
“He’s in the dining-room, sir, along with mistress. I’ll show you
up-stairs, if you please.”
“Thank’ee. He knows me,” said Scrooge, with his hand already
on the dining-room lock. “I’ll go in here, my dear.”
He turned it gently, and sidled his face in, round the door. They
were looking at the table (which was spread out in great array);
for these young housekeepers are always nervous on such
points, and like to see that everything is right.
“Fred!” said Scrooge.
Dear heart alive, how his niece by marriage started! Scrooge
had forgotten, for the moment, about her sitting in the corner
with the footstool, or he wouldn’t have done it, on any account.
“Why bless my soul!” cried Fred, “who’s that?”
“It’s I. Your uncle Scrooge. I have come to dinner. Will you let
me in, Fred?”
Let him in! It is a mercy he didn’t shake his arm off. He was at
home in five minutes. Nothing could be heartier. His niece
looked just the same. So did Topper when he came. So did the
plump sister when she came. So did every one when they came.
Wonderful party, wonderful games, wonderful unanimity, wonder-
ful happiness!
125
But he was early at the office next morning. Oh, he was early
there. If he could only be there first, and catch Bob Cratchit
coming late! That was the thing he had set his heart upon.
And he did it; yes, he did! The clock struck nine. No Bob. A
quarter past. No Bob. He was full eighteen minutes and a half
behind his time. Scrooge sat with his door wide open, that he
might see him come into the Tank.
His hat was off, before he opened the door; his comforter too.
He was on his stool in a jiffy; driving away with his pen, as if he
were trying to overtake nine o’clock.
“Hallo!” growled Scrooge, in his accustomed voice, as near as
he could feign it. “What do you mean by coming here at this
time of day?”
“I am very sorry, sir,” said Bob. “I am behind my time.”
“You are?” repeated Scrooge. “Yes. I think you are. Step this
way, sir, if you please.”
“It’s only once a year, sir,” pleaded Bob, appearing from the
Tank. “It shall not be repeated. I was making rather merry
yesterday, sir.”
“Now, I’ll tell you what, my friend,” said Scrooge, “I am not
going to stand this sort of thing any longer. And therefore,” he
continued, leaping from
126
his stool, and giving Bob such a dig in the waistcoat that he
staggered back into the Tank again; “and therefore I am about
to raise your salary!”
Bob trembled, and got a little nearer to the ruler. He had a
momentary idea of knocking Scrooge down with it, holding him,
and calling to the people in the court for help and a straitwaistcoat.
“A merry Christmas, Bob!” said Scrooge, with an earnestness
that could not be mistaken, as he clapped him on the back. “A
merrier Christmas, Bob, my good fellow, than I have given you,
for many a year! I’ll raise your salary, and endeavour to assist
your struggling family, and we will discuss your affairs this very
afternoon, over a Christmas bowl of smoking bishop, Bob! Make
up the fires, and buy another coal-scuttle before you dot
another i, Bob Cratchit!”
Scrooge was better than his word. He did it all, and infinitely
more; and to Tiny Tim, who did not die, he was a second father.
He became as good a friend, as good a master, and as good a
man, as the good old city knew, or any other good old city,
town, or borough, in the good old world. Some people laughed
to see the alteration in him, but he let them laugh, and little
heeded them; for he was wise enough to know that nothing ever
happened on this globe, for good, at which some people did not
have their fill of laughter in the outset; and knowing that such as
these would be blind anyway, he thought it quite as well that
they should wrinkle up their eyes in grins, as have the malady in
